# This is part of my tour on codewars.com. The code below is a solution to a problem.

# INSTRUCTIONS: Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.
# (In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).
